Bunny Bakery is a puzzle matching game made in p3

This game includes the following features (and more!):
* match 3 desserts to clear the row
* chain multiplier for sequential matches
* particle effects

There are several bugs which need to be worked out as I find the time. 

Known issues:
* code needs cleaned up and refactored
* need support for simultaneous matches
* would be nice to add a wildcard powerup
