Earth Intruders is a Space Invaders clone in p3

My take on this game includes the following features (and more!):
* backgrounds can be cycled with level progression
* sprites are drawn from data
* enemies include several movement patterns
* level progression in waves
* particle effects 
* sound effects

I may add a few finishing touches such as power-ups later.

Known issues:
* enemy hitbox needs expanded to aid player
